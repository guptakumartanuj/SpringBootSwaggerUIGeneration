# My Application API through Swagger UI

#To run the application, Go to browser and type localhost:8080 and you will see Swagger UI having all the apis mentioned in the RESTController.

#Note* @Controller annotation is used in RootController to redirect the Swagger UI and @RESTController annotation is used in TestController to get listing of all the APIs through Swagger UI.
